# Augmented Reality Target Shooter

This Human Computer Interaction project aimed at detection of the mid-point between eye-brows, by using HaarCascade classifier and OpenCV. The first module, hci.py works on detection using webcam and the second module hci_yt.py downloads videos from youtube when URL is specified and the faces in the videos are detected. This purpose of this project was to faciltate AR Target shooting.
